The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of SBT's history most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Cazalbé's humor, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his jokes draw heavily from classic Brazillian comedy literature like Jorge Amado and Luis Fernando Verissimo, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike A Praça é Nossa truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Cazalbé's existencial catchphrase \"Eu aqui no meu velho e querido banco; vocês em todo o Brasil. Por quê?\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Dyonélio Machado's only success \"Os Ratos\". I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Nobrega's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. joy And yes by the way, I DO have a banco da praça tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.");
